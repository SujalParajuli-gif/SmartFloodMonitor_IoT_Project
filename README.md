# Smart Flood Monitoring Project

This project is a **smart flood detection system** developed using **IoT-based hardware and sensors**, designed to monitor water levels and environmental conditions in real-time. Built by **Team 2 â€“ L2C10**, the system aims to help predict potential flood scenarios and issue timely alerts.

The hardware setup includes:
- **NodeMCU (ESP8266)** for Wi-Fi communication
- **Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)** for water level measurement
- **DHT11** for temperature and humidity monitoring
- Integration with a **web-based dashboard** and real-time data transmission

The solution is built with a focus on **early warning systems**, leveraging low-cost components and basic microcontroller programming to support disaster preparedness and mitigation.
